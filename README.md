# Anthony's (bad) Racket Interpreter

This is an interpreter to run the [Racket programming language](https://racket-lang.org/) (in progress). More specifically this will loosely implement the [Beginning Student](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner.html) version of Racket.

It is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) because I wanted to get better at programming in Rust and also needed more projects to pad my Resume.

current to do: Make the parsing more resilient

Things to look forward to:
- [x] Arithmetic (+, -, /, *, mod)
- [x] Booleans (and, or, not, xor, etc.)
- [x] Comparisons (=, <, >, etc.)
- [x] If statements
- [ ] conditional statements
- [x] Meaningful error messages that don't immediately crash the interpreter
- [x] Variables
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Functions (Both lambda and defined)
- [x] REPL
- [x] Running External Files



Things I probably won't get to:
- Structs
- Imperatives
- Mutable data
